# Stability selection with LAD-LASSO
This repository provides the R code used for the stability selection analysis in combination with LAD-LASSO.
In fact, this is a mariage between stabs (Hofner & Hothorn, 2015) and hqreg (Yi, 2017) pkgs in R, which can be used for stability selection with error control and robust regression, respectively. We have utilized the R code in our newly published paper (Elyasiani & Movaghari, 2022).
